# Create a function called greetings that takes one argument as string and returns the name

#def greeting(name):
#    return "Welcome " + name

#print(greeting("Jose"))

# Declare a list of numbers from 1 - 9.
# Iterate through the list and print the list
# declare, list, iterate, print
#numList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

#for item in numList:
#    print(item)

# Write boolean operators
# If a == b and c == d print true
# write an example of the boolean operators

#if "a" == "b" and "c" == "d":
#    print(True)

# Create a list of five numbers, starting from zero

#numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

#for num in range(5):
#    numbers.append(num)

# Create a tuple with the same information

#tuple_number = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
#numbers_tuple = tuple(numbers)
#print(tuple_number)
#print(numbers_tuple)

# Change the value fot the tuple in the last index

# CAN NOT CHANGE A TUPLE
# BECAUSE TUPLES ARE IMMUTABLE
# UNLIKE LISTS, THAT CAN BE CHANGED AS THEY ARE MUTABLE

# Create a dictionary with 2 key pairs
# first key is 'name' and the value of the name is James
# second key is 'age', and the value is an int 18
# print tha values of keys
